      As a 4rd-year computer engineering student, I have gained experience in developing applications
      and websites using Flutter, Java and Kotlin. I am skilled in using HTML and JavaScript for web
      development, and have completed several projects using these technologies.I am currently seeking
      a challenging internship opportunity in the field of computer engineering, where I can further
      develop my skills and gain practical experience. This is my 5th week assignment using the React
      component structure within the scope of the React course I attended at MEGA Software Academy.
